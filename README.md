<!-- I created this repository from March 2020, for the first time I just practice for interviewing, but after I solved about 30 problems (a week after), I gave a lookback to ensure that I'm not wasting my time and I did. I just focusing on solving problem and ignore to think about the philosophy, the abstraction about it, indeed I solved the problem on Leetcode but I got nothing. 

Thus I changed my approaching, by taking care a lot about the problem, thinking about how it can be applicated in the real-life, how I can solve it in an intuitive manner, etc. Then I got a new view about the generic and specialist and many good things which let me solving the problem better.

After all, I learnt that:  -->

A problem has many methods to solve, each method may emerges many problems
