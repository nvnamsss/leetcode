- my career
 - love game industry in the very first time of career
 - decided to get rid of it and improve skill instead of gaining experience
 - join EyeQ Tech for learning and practicing about DevOps Engineer
 - Intratech approaches and would like me to join their team for researching and implementing software in 3D field
 - after I have done my last work in Intratech, I applied to VinID

- my work
 - talk a little bit about VinID, a super app created by and for VinGroup, they have the biggest ecosystem in Vietnam
 - my field related to gamification, we design, implement and run many campaigns for VinID
 - mostly focusing on the Rule System, briefly we create a system where we have some inputs, from there inputs we determine which actions would be triggerd, like if I buy something in the supermarket, I could get some voucher or discount on it.
 - focus on building the Rule Engine, keep it works fastly, efficiently. 
 - the use case of both are difference. I help it to fine-grained the rules so we could run a smaller subset of rules thus yielding faster performance, secondly I have changed the implementation of RETE algorithm, so the overall performance is increased approximately 5 times compare to the old Rule Engine
 - must satisfy all stakeholders so try to reduce effort in repeatitive tasks are required
